# Android samples

This git repo is holding all my android samples, in order to avoid 1 repo for each small projects.

It's also a good way to use a multi-module approach with Gradle, not really used in daily Android devs.

## Gomobile

Integration of go mobile inside an Android project.
See submodule [README](gomobile/README.md) for details.

## Dagger2

- [Dagger 1 to 2 migration process](http://frogermcs.github.io/dagger-1-to-2-migration/)
- [Tasting Dagger 2 on Android](http://fernandocejas.com/2015/04/11/tasting-dagger-2-on-android/)

## MergeDrawable

Use Bitmap or Drawable in order to draw a cover and a watermark on bottom/right.

Render this merge on a view and on sdcard.

## viewpager-inception

ViewPager experiments:

- view pager inside another view pager
- dynamically add pagers
- navigate with button
